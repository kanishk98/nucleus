### named option

Users sending a request to connect see that they're being matched (and possibly rejected). The receiver of the request sees who is sending them the request and they have the chance to decline. The connection automatically switches to another recipient after the latter ignoring the sender of the request for more than 5 seconds. 

### anonymous option

Users send a request to connect, and if there are other people available using the platform, they are automatically logged in to chat with the person sending the request.
